## 📌 Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

### 🎯 Objective
To **use SQL queries** to extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data from a database.  
This task focuses on applying **SQL concepts** such as filtering, joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and query optimization.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- 🐬 MySQL *(primary tool used)*  
- 🐘 PostgreSQL / 🗄️ SQLite *(alternatives if required)*  
- 📂 Dataset: `Ecommerce_SQL_Database` (or any structured dataset of choice)  

---

## 🗂 Steps Performed
1. **Basic Data Extraction**  
   - Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY` to filter and sort data.  

2. **Aggregations**  
   - Applied `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `GROUP BY` for summary statistics.  

3. **Joins**  
   - Implemented `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN` to combine tables.  

4. **Subqueries**  
   - Used nested queries to extract conditional insights.  

5. **Views**  
   - Created SQL views for reusable analysis.  

6. **Optimization**  
   - Checked query execution plans.  
   - Used indexes where necessary to improve performance.
